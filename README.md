👋 Hello there, I'm a data scientist with a passion for machine learning and deep learning. I harness the power of cloud infrastructure development (AWS, Azure, etc.) to explore data and gain insights.

🌐 I'm also a big fan of data science competitions like Kaggle, where I compete and hone my skills in data analysis and modeling. Competitions serve as my learning and growth playground, and collaborating with other data enthusiasts to solve challenges brings me joy.

🎮 Furthermore, I dabble in game development as a hobby, using Unity. The fusion of data science and game development brings forth exciting possibilities and creativity.

In the world of data, my mission is to leverage the power of machine learning, drawing from my experience in cloud technology and data science competitions. Let's explore the potential of data together! 🚀
